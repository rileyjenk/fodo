# Function Title

Your function title needs to be an acitve verb - doing something, such as: *Implementing automation*, *Managing commitments*, *Reviewing reports*. It should be a task that the FinOps professional will be doing.
If there are multilple tasks that will be incorporated into the function, consider titles such as *managing X*, *Operating X*, *Implementing X*.

The aim is to reduce ambiguity such as *learning*:
- How *I* will learn as a FinOps practitioner, this will guide me to becoming a better FinOps practitioner
- How I will implement a learning program for *others* in my organization, this is a resource I will use to achieve something as a practitioner

*tagging*?
- Implementing tagging
- Using tagging?
- Managing tagging - definition, implementing, managment


## Introduction

Be brief and concise, assume there will be a minimal level of knowledge of the subject area by the reader. There will also be more detailed documentation such as whitepapers on the topic for depth, so focus on the most impactful points.

The goal here is to ease them into the topic and get them in the right mindset. Things you need to cover:
- Define the function topic: in 1 sentence explain what it is you are managing/implementing. Consider the following format: Automation replaces repetitive tasks with code.
- Explain what it does and why its required: add the benefit to the previous sentence. Consider the following format: Automation replaces repetitve tasks with code, this removes operational overhead reducing your costs and allows you to scale faster.
- Define the main areas of the topic: (if required) list the main areas in order that they need to be considered/implemented, they will be defined/explained later. Consider: Automation has 3 parts: idenftify , deployment, maintenance reviews.



## Sample Implementation

Place a simple digram of what a sample implementation or cycle would look like, it should have no more than 12 components in it.


## Common Approaches

(not too sure here)
(Describe the sample implementation above?)
(Describe other implementations?)
(describe how to get to the sample implementation? - but that would be the maturity examples below)



## Maturity Examples

(Clarification: is this to help people identify where they are at - which would be listing potentially anti-patterns, or is it listing *only* the best practices that they should be doing at each step? - or is it both? identify where they are at & what they should be doing?)
(i'll take the latter approach - help people understand where they are & what they should be doing)

In each phase (crawl, walk, run) identify one incorrect practice that people are doing at this stage, to help them identify where they are at. If there are many, simply state the most common, easiest & most impactful one that will be identified by most organizations. Just state the incorrect practice, do not address why its bad or the impact. There will always be 1 incorrect practice at the crawl, there may not be incorrect practices at walk/run.
State the incorrect practice in a positive way - do not state the opposite of the best practice. Consider: Users are doing repetitve tasks manually. Do not use: Users are *not doing* things programatically.

Then state what customers should be doing at this stage to rectify the issue. If there are multilpe things to do - group them into a higher level concept, or state the most common and simple things. Each activity must result in a change or have something implemented, and be completed in the stage. Tasks like *Planning*, *considering*, or *producing* will not result in a change and should not be used. Partially completing an activity or completing an activity on a small scale such as *automate simple tasks* or *automate some tasks* followed by *automate all tasks* should not be used.
keep it simple, 1 or 2 sentences for each, focus on the outcomes or what is delivered, do not specify the busy tasks required to produce the output.


- *Crawl* = You are performing repetitive tasks manually. Implement a process to identify repetitve tasks that can be automatied.
- *Walk* = You automate repetitive tasks. You implement tooling to automate tasks.
- *Run* = All repetitve tasks are automated. When creating new workloads you incorporate automation to 


## Common KPIs

(How hard/firm do we want to be here?
are flexible/aspirational goals that work for most ok? or do they need to be correct for all cases?)
KPI's should/must be data driven or provable, *sounds about right* or *most people think x* arent valid KPIs
KPI's can be inferred from cusotmer success? Most successful customers do X

## Cautionary Tales

When looking at what they should do above, they can do the right things in the wrong way, or rely too much on one & not the other. Here you further guide them to ensure they're getting the right outcomes, by adding some more definition or calling out a way that a good thing can result in a bad result.
